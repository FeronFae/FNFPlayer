_*Dependencies:*_ 
- Keyboard
- Pyautogui

_*Requierments:*_
- Game must be in fullscreen windowed mode (on a 1080p display)
- Game must be completely centered
- Due to some issues with the win32DC Release function of pyscreeze (used by the pyautogui module for pixel scanning) in Python 3.8+, you must run this script with any version of [Python _3.7]_ (I will update this segment whenever the pyautogui issue is resolved. You can follow any updates [here](https://github.com/asweigart/pyscreeze/issues/72).
